### Personal NixOS  configuration

You really shouldn't use this for anything for the following reasons:
1.  I am hacking my way around nix without actually learning the language.
2.  It is highly, highly personalized.
3.  There are far better resources available to copy/learn from/do anything with.
4.  This is a mess
